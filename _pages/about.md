Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I am a doctoral student at the Department of [Computer Science at ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://inf.ethz.ch/), fortunate to be advised by [Gustavo Alonso](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/alonso/) and [Ana Klimovic](https://anakli.inf.ethz.ch/) as a member of the [Systems Group](https://systems.ethz.ch/). I obtained my MSc degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the [University of Patras](https://www.upatras.gr/en/).

Currently, I am exploring the area of vector search. My interests lie in database and machine learning systems research, with a focus on accelerating machine learning pipelines and building systems that harness emerging hardware/memory trends and adapt to workload changes.

In the past, I interned at EPFL in the Data Intensive Applications & Systems Lab ([DIAS](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/dias/)), at CERN with the [Rucio](https://rucio.cern.ch/) team, and at one of the largest ship-management companies, [Thenamaris](https://www.thenamaris.com/).


[//]: # "During my studies, I explored my interest in aerospace engineering by leading [EUROAVIA Patras](https://patras.euroavia.eu/) and being part of the founding team. I helped organize international [rocketry competitions](https://sloshing.euroavia.eu/), design model rockets, and be part of unforgettable experiences such as [piloting light aircraft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt_PKnsNZXw)."
