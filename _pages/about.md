Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I am a first-year doctoral student at the Department of [Computer Science at ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://inf.ethz.ch/), fortunate to be advised by [Gustavo Alonso](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/alonso/), [Ana Klimovic](https://anakli.inf.ethz.ch/) and [Theo Rekatsinas](https://thodrek.github.io/) and to be a member of the [Systems Group](https://systems.ethz.ch/). I obtained my MSc degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the [University of Patras](https://www.upatras.gr/en/).

Currently, I am exploring vector search engines and augmented language models. My interests lie in database and machine learning systems research, with a focus on accelerating machine learning pipelines and building systems that harness emerging hardware/memory trends and adapt to workload changes.

In the past, I interned at EPFL, under the supervision of [Anastasia Ailamaki](https://people.epfl.ch/anastasia.ailamaki/?lang=en), working on join order optimization. Before that, I worked at [CERN](https://home.web.cern.ch/) in the scientific data management team [Rucio](https://rucio.cern.ch/) on retrieval-agumented transformer models. I also interned at one of the largest ship-management companies, [Thenamaris](https://www.thenamaris.com/), where I developed tool to classify supply buy/no-buy opportunities for the 2B$+ vessel fleet across on all world ports.

[//]: # "During my studies, I explored my interest in aerospace engineering by leading [EUROAVIA Patras](https://patras.euroavia.eu/) and being part of the founding team. I helped organize international [rocketry competitions](https://sloshing.euroavia.eu/), design model rockets, and be part of unforgettable experiences such as [piloting light aircraft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt_PKnsNZXw)."
