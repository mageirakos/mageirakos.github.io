Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I am a doctoral student in the [Computer Science Department at ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://inf.ethz.ch/), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Gustavo Alonso](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/alonso/) and [Ana Klimovic](https://anakli.inf.ethz.ch/) as part of the [Systems Group](https://systems.ethz.ch/). I hold an MSc in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the [University of Patras](https://www.upatras.gr/en/). 

My research interests lie at the intersection of database and machine learning systems, with a particular focus on vector search systems and systems which dynamically adapt to workload changes, as well as in accelerating machine learning pipelines, and leveraging emerging hardware technologies.

Beyond academia, I have gained industry experience working on the low-latency networking performance engineering team at [Jump Trading](https://www.jumptrading.com/) and contributing to the [Rucio](https://rucio.cern.ch/) team at CERN, where I developed one of the earliest open-source Retrieval-Augmented ML [question-answering chatbots](https://github.com/rucio/donkeybot). Additionally, I participated in [Summer@EPFL](https://summer.epfl.ch/) at the Data-Intensive Applications & Systems Lab ([DIAS](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/dias/)), focusing on [GPU-accelerated join order optimization](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3514221.3517871). I also interned at [Thenamaris](https://www.thenamaris.com/), where I worked on predictive models for global supply chain optimization within one of the world's largest ship management companies.  

[//]: # "During my studies, I explored my interest in aerospace engineering by leading [EUROAVIA Patras](https://patras.euroavia.eu/) and being part of the founding team. I helped organize international [rocketry competitions](https://sloshing.euroavia.eu/), design model rockets, and be part of unforgettable experiences such as [piloting light aircraft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt_PKnsNZXw)."
