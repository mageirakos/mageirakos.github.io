Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I am a first-year doctoral student at the Department of [Computer Science at ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://inf.ethz.ch/), fortunate to be advised by [Theo Rekatsinas](https://thodrek.github.io/) and to be a member of the [Systems Group](https://systems.ethz.ch/).   
I obtained my MSc degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the [University of Patras](https://www.upatras.gr/en/).

I am broadly interested in database and machine learning system research. More specifically, how we can build data-centric systems that accelerate machine learning pipelines, utilize emerging hardware/memory trends, and automatically adapt to workload and hardware changes. 

In the past, I interned at the [DIAS Lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/dias/) at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), under the supervision of [Anastasia Ailamaki](https://people.epfl.ch/anastasia.ailamaki/?lang=en), where I worked on [GPU accelerated join optimization for large queries](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3514221.3517871). Previously, I also worked at [CERN](https://home.web.cern.ch/) in the scientific data management team [Rucio](https://rucio.cern.ch/), and at one of the largest ship-management companies, [Thenamaris](https://www.thenamaris.com/), as part of the ML/BI team.

[//]: # "During my studies, I explored my interest in aerospace engineering by leading [EUROAVIA Patras](https://patras.euroavia.eu/) and being part of the founding team. I helped organize international [rocketry competitions](https://sloshing.euroavia.eu/), design model rockets, and be part of unforgettable experiences such as [piloting light aircraft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt_PKnsNZXw)."
